# Addressing Large Hadron Collider Challenges by Machine Learning

In this repository, I'd be sharing my solutions for the assignments of this course. A few of the problems lack enough explanation as to what needs to be done. So I'm hoping this repository might be to help you pass the assignment faster.

I've also added a few short comments in the code blocks, starting with `NOTE` to explain the problem at hand or the coding decisions I've made.
